# # Kolmogorov flow (2D)
#
# The Kolmogorov flow in a periodic box ``\Omega = [0, 1]^2`` is initiated
# via the force field
#
# ```math
# f(x, y) =
# \begin{pmatrix}
#     \sin(\pi k y) \\
#     0
# \end{pmatrix}
# ```
#
# where `k` is the wavenumber where energy is injected.

# ## Packages
#
# We just need the `IncompressibleNavierStokes` and a Makie plotting package.

#md using CairoMakie
using GLMakie #!md
using IncompressibleNavierStokes

# ## Setup
#
# Define a uniform grid with a steady body force field.

#
# Since the force is steady, it is just stored as a field.
