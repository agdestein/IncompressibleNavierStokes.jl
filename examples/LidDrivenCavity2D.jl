# # Tutorial: Lid-Driven Cavity - 2D
#
# In this example we consider a box with a moving lid. The velocity is
# initially at rest. The solution should reach at steady state equilibrium
# after a certain time. The same steady state should be obtained when solving a
# steady state problem.

# We start by loading packages.
# A [Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) plotting backend is needed
#
# for plotting. `GLMakie` creates an interactive window (useful for real-time
# plotting), but does not work when building this example on GitHub.
# `CairoMakie` makes high-quality static vector-graphics plots.

# The code allows for using different floating point number types, including single
# precision (`Float32`) and double precision (`Float64`). On the CPU, the speed
# is not really different, but double precision uses twice as much memory as
# single precision. When running on the GPU, single precision is preferred.
# Half precision (`Float16`) is also an option, but then the values should be
# scaled judiciously to avoid vanishing digits when applying differential
# operators of the form "right minus left divided by small distance".

# Note how floating point type hygiene is enforced in the following using `T`
# to avoid mixing different precisions.

# T = Float64
T = Float32
## T = Float16

# We can also choose to do the computations on a different device. By default,
# the computations are performed on the host (CPU). An optional `backend`
# allows for moving arrays to a different device such as a GPU.
#
# Note: For GPUs, single precision is preferred.

# Here we choose a moderate Reynolds number. Note how we pass the floating point type.

setup = Setup(; x, boundary_conditions, Re, backend);

# The initial conditions are provided in function. The value `dim()` determines
# the velocity component.
ustart = velocityfield(setup, (dim, x, y) -> zero(x));

# useful for logging, plotting, or saving results. Their respective outputs are
# later returned by `solve_unsteady`.
