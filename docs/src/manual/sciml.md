# Using IncompressibleNavierStokes in SciML

The [SciML organization](https://sciml.ai/) is a collection of tools for solving equations and modeling systems. It has a coherent development principle, unified APIs over large collections of equation solvers, pervasive differentiability and sensitivity analysis, and features many of the highest performance and parallel implementations one can find.

In particular, [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/) contains tools to solve differential equations defined as $\dfrac{du}{dt} = f(u, t)$ that include a large collection of solvers, sensitivity analysis, and more.

Using IncompressibleNavierStokes it is possible to write the momentum equations without the pressure by explicitly solving the discrete Poisson equation and obtaining:

```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} u_h}{\mathrm{d} t} &= (I - G L^{-1} W M)
(F(u_h) - y_G) - G L^{-1} W \frac{\mathrm{d} y_M}{\mathrm{d} t}\\ &=f(u_h).
\end{align*}
```

The derivation and the drawbacks of this approach are discussed in the documentation.

This projected right-hand side can be used in the SciML solvers to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. The following example shows how to use the SciML solvers to solve the ODEs obtained from the Navier-Stokes equations.

!!! note "OrdinaryDiffEqTsit5"
    We here use the explicit solver `Tsit5` from OrdinaryDiffEqTsit5 directly to
    skip loading all the toolchains for implicit solvers, which takes a while to
    install on GitHub.

```@example SciML
using OrdinaryDiffEqTsit5
using IncompressibleNavierStokes
ax = range(0, 1, 101)
setup = Setup(;
    x = (ax, ax),
    boundary_conditions = (;
        u = (
            (PeriodicBC(), PeriodicBC()),
            (PeriodicBC(), PeriodicBC()),
        ),
    ),
)
psolver = default_psolver(setup)
f = create_right_hand_side(setup, psolver)
u0 = random_field(setup)
tspan = (0.0, 1.0)     # time span where to solve.
problem = ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, (; viscosity = 2e-3)) #SciMLBase.ODEProblem
sol = solve(problem, Tsit5(), reltol = 1e-8, abstol = 1e-8) # sol: SciMLBase.ODESolution
```

Alternatively, it is also possible to use an [in-place formulation](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/problem/#In-place-vs-Out-of-Place-Function-Definition-Forms)

```@example SciML
viscosity = 2e-3
f!(du,u,p,t) = right_hand_side!(du, u, Ref((setup, psolver, viscosity)), t)
u = similar(u0)
du = similar(u0)
p = nothing
t = 0.0
f!(du,u,p,t)
```
that is usually faster than the out-of-place formulation.

You can look [here](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/basics/overview/) for more information on how to use the SciML solvers and all the options available.
