These eddies create sub-grid stresses that also affect the large scale features. The grid must be refined if we want to compute these stresses exactly.</p><p>On the right, the smallest spatial feature of the flow is fully resolved, and there are no sub-grid stresses. The equations can be solved without worrying about errors from unresolved features.

The models only give an estimate for these stresses, and may need to be calibrated to the given problem. When used correctly, they can predict the evolution of the large fluid motions without computing the sub-grid motions themselves.
